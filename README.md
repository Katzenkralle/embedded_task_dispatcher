# embedded\_task\_dispatcher

This library allows you to easily create one or more suites filled with tasks that conditionally execute based on rules you define. Additionally, you can divide your tasks into subunits that are arranged in a tree structure, allowing you to enable or disable task evaluation based on abstracted conditions.

The library also handles initialization of FPIO pins and other variables needed for the conditions, while still giving you full control over the environment as required.

> **Note:**
>
> * Documentation will follow soon.
> * The implementation of the LCD driver is temporary and on hold to be rewritten.
> * We are still in early development â€” expect bugs and changes to the internal data structure. (The user-facing helper functions should remain stable.)
